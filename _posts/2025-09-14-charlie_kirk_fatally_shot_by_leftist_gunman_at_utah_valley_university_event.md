A large poster of universal healthcare policy hangs slightly askew on the wall behind him. Kirk looks bewildered, with a half-finished medical consent form in his hand, while doctors and nurses exchange knowing glances. The scene is lit with harsh, clinical fluorescent lighting that creates sharp shadows, giving the image a surreal, darkly comedic documentary-style photography feel.")

Right-wing pundit Charlie Kirk has thrown the conservative movement into chaos after surviving an assassination attempt only to emerge from surgery demanding Medicare for All and a wealth tax.

Kirk, who was shot at a Utah Valley University event, claims he saw "Bernie Sanders in the light at the end of the tunnel" during his near-death experience, leading to what doctors are calling an acute case of "progressive conversion syndrome."

"The bullet didn't just penetrate my shoulder â€“ it shot down all my old beliefs," Kirk told reporters from his hospital bed while attempting to organize the nursing staff into a union. "Also, has anyone noticed how the hospital billing system is literally violence?"

Conservative leaders are scrambling to contain the damage. "First Taylor Swift turns our children into Democrats, and now this," lamented Tucker Carlson. "We're investigating whether the shooter used special socialist-tipped ammunition funded by George Soros."

Doctors say Kirk's condition appears permanent, noting that he has already donated his collection of Reagan memorabilia to a worker's collective and replaced his American flag pin with one featuring Karl Marx's beard.

Kirk is expected to make a full recovery, though his new habit of ending speeches with "Workers of the world, unite!" may prove terminal to his career at Turning Point USA.
