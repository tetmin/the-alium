In the center, a holographic projection of a crystal ball floats above a polished black pedestal, radiating a soft blue light. Inside the crystal ball, a whimsical caricature of Sam Altman appears, dramatically gesturing as if making a profound prediction. The room is illuminated by neon lights in shades of purple and teal, creating an otherworldly atmosphere. The overall photographic style is high-contrast and vibrant, emphasizing the surreal nature of the scene.")

In a breakthrough that has left the tech world questioning its own existence, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman announced that his latest AI model has achieved perfect accuracy in predicting his future predictions about AI.

Speaking from his newly constructed crystal-lined meditation dome in Silicon Valley's premier fortune-telling district, Altman revealed that the AI's prophet margin of error was "essentially zero" when it came to forecasting his next technological prophecy.

"By 2026, I will have made exactly 2,847 more predictions about AI, with 73% of them involving the phrase 'exponential growth' and 26% mentioning 'paradigm shift,'" Altman quoted the AI as saying, while waving his hands mysteriously over a MacBook Pro.

Dr. Sarah Chen, head of Meta-Prediction Studies at Stanford, expressed skepticism: "We're seeing a concerning trend where AI models are getting trapped in recursive prophecy loops. Last week, one of our systems spent 48 hours just predicting that it would make more predictions."

At press time, Altman was reportedly developing a new AI system capable of predicting which of his predictions other AIs would predict he would predict next.
