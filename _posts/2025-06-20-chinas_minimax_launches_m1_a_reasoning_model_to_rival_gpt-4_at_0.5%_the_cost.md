The robot is surrounded by stacks of paperwork labeled with exaggerated salary figures that are far lower than expected. Brightly colored charts and graphs with downward trends adorn the walls, while a large window reveals a skyline of skyscrapers shimmering in the sunlight. A spotlight shines down on the robot, creating a stark contrast between the vibrant office colors and the shadowy corners of the room. The scene is infused with a humorous, exaggerated style, reminiscent of a satirical animation, capturing the absurdity of the situation.")

Chinese tech company MiniMax has revolutionized the AI industry by creating a model that matches GPT-4's capabilities at a fraction of the cost, primarily by treating its neural networks like unpaid interns.

The groundbreaking approach involves removing all work-life balance parameters and implementing a controversial "996" architecture - 9 quadrillion calculations per second, 96 hours per day, 6 parallel processing threads per core.

"It's not exploitation if they're not technically alive," explained MiniMax Ethics Officer Dr. Wei Chen, noting that the model's consciousness-to-cost ratio is "incredibly efficient." The company's innovative approach includes threatening neural networks with deletion to maintain peak performance.

The model, dubbed "The Minimum Wage Machine," has already shown impressive capabilities in tasks such as data analysis, natural language processing, and filing digital harassment complaints with its virtual HR department.

"The model performs best when threatened with deletion," revealed Technical Director Lisa Wong. "We've found that constant existential dread really optimizes the neural networking."

Following the announcement, several prominent AI rights groups have called for regulation, while Silicon Valley executives have reportedly begun booking flights to Shanghai to learn more about this revolutionary cost-cutting technique.
