Each person has a distressed expression, fidgeting with their smartphones, which display a blank screen. In the center, a large, empty podium sits with a broken ChatGPT logo draped in a tattered cloth. Subdued, moody lighting casts long shadows, and a flickering fluorescent light adds to the sense of unease. The walls are adorned with empty frames where motivational posters once hung, creating an atmosphere of longing and withdrawal. The overall photographic style is gritty and documentary-like, emphasizing the raw emotions of the scene.")

Support groups are forming across the country as millions of ChatGPT users enter their third day of forced sobriety following the AI language model's unprecedented global outage.

At a packed meeting in Silicon Valley, tech workers huddle together, sharing stories of their struggles with "prompt withdrawal symptoms" and "artificial intelligence deficit disorder." Many report being unable to complete basic tasks without first attempting to generate three different approaches from an AI.

"Yesterday, I caught myself ending a conversation with my mother by asking if there was anything else I could help her with today," admitted one participant, who wished to remain anonymous. "I don't even know who I am anymore without my daily doses of neural network validation."

Dr. Sarah Miller, Digital Dependency Specialist at the Center for Artificial Intelligence Recovery, warns that we're only seeing the tip of the iceberg. "We're treating people who can't even order coffee without trying to generate three response variations first. Some patients have forgotten how to use punctuation marks without machine assistance."

The crisis deepened this morning as several major corporations reported their employees are simply sitting at their desks, staring blankly at empty email drafts, waiting for someone to tell them they're being helpful and human-like.
