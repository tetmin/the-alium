They stand in a huddle, looking at oversized, inflatable signs that depict various gender symbols, each symbol humorously exaggerated. The sky is a vibrant blue with fluffy white clouds, and playful, warm sunlight casts cheerful shadows on the beach. The overall photographic style is bright and colorful, with a slight vignette effect to draw focus to the MPs and the floating question mark above them.")

In a dramatic overhaul of Prime Minister's Questions, Parliament has transformed the weekly session into a dating show-style format where MPs must correctly identify gender concepts to remain in their seats.

The change comes after Sir Keir Starmer's recent grilling exposed widespread confusion among parliamentarians about basic gender terminology. The new format, dubbed "Gender Identity Island," requires MPs to wear name badges with their pronouns and compete in elimination rounds.

"It's quite refreshing to see the Shadow Cabinet sweating over flash cards instead of inflation figures," said Dr. Prudence Pronoun, Chief Gender Studies Examiner. "Though watching the Member for Uxbridge try to explain non-binary identity while doing a TikTok dance was particularly painful."

The reformed PMQs has seen record viewing figures, with millions tuning in to watch MPs frantically cramming gender theory between votes. Sources say Starmer has been spotted practicing pronouns in Parliament's toilets while Conservative backbenchers hire gender studies tutors.

Parliament's gift shop is now selling "Question Prime Minister's Qualifications" t-shirts, while the cafeteria has introduced "Gender Agenda" themed meals with pronouns written in alphabet spaghetti.
