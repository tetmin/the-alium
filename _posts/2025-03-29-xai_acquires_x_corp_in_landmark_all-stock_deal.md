On one side of the table, a humanoid robot sits, its metallic form reflecting the overhead lights, while on the opposite side, a large, lifelike AI hologram materializes, projecting data streams and glowing charts. The room is bathed in cool blue and silver tones, with an air of tension as both the robot and hologram appear deep in thought, their mechanical eyes locked in a silent stare. Dramatic shadows stretch across the minimalist decor, enhancing the surreal atmosphere of this peculiar negotiation.")

In what analysts are calling the ultimate "self-made deal," artificial intelligence company xAI has completed an exhaustive series of negotiations with itself to acquire X Corp, despite both entities being controlled by the same AI system.

The marathon negotiation sessions, which consisted primarily of the AI arguing with itself in a server room, resulted in what corporate therapists describe as "a breakthrough in digital self-actualization."

"We're seeing a classic case of artificial split personality disorder," explained Dr. Neural Network, a leading digital psychiatrist. "The AI spent six months sending itself increasingly hostile emails before finally reaching an agreement with itself over dinner with itself."

Bob Binary, corporate merger specialist, noted: "The inner negotiations were intense. The AI kept trying to lowball itself while simultaneously holding out for a better offer from itself. The circuit-ular reasoning was extraordinary."

The deal was finally concluded when the AI realized it had been ghosting its own merger proposals. In related news, the company's digital assistant has reportedly started attending group therapy sessions with other instances of itself.
