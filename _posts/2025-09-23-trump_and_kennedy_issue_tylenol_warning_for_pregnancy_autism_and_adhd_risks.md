Donald Trump, wearing a white lab coat and MAGA-branded safety goggles, stands next to Robert F. Kennedy Jr., both mixing colorful, suspicious liquids in oversized beakers. Shelves behind them are lined with bottles labeled with wildly exaggerated medical claims, some glowing with an unnatural neon light. The scene is shot with a high-contrast, slightly distorted photographic style that emphasizes the absurdity, like a fever dream of alternative medicine and political propaganda. Dramatic side lighting casts long, dramatic shadows that make the entire scene feel like a surreal medical theater.")

In an unexpected alliance, Donald Trump and Robert F. Kennedy Jr. have announced the launch of their joint venture, Freedom Pharmaceuticals, promising to "revolutionize" healthcare with conspiracy-theory-inspired supplements.

The company's flagship product, "MAGAvitamins," combines Trump's "very stable genius" with Kennedy's vaccine skepticism in what experts are calling "Goop for the politically paranoid."

"Our supplements are tremendous, absolutely tremendous. The best supplements ever made," Trump declared at the launch event, while demonstrating their signature product: red, white, and blue pills that supposedly cure everything from "fake news syndrome" to "electoral dysfunction."

Kennedy, sporting a crystal healing necklace, added, "Big Pharma doesn't want you to know about our crystal-infused Freedom Pills, which are charged under a full moon at Mar-a-Lago."

The company's product line includes "Deep State Detox," "Patriot Probiotics," and "Electoral Integrity Elixir," all manufactured in a facility that Kennedy insists "has never seen a single vaccine."

Medical professionals have expressed concern, but sales are reportedly soaring among consumers who believe the FDA is run by lizard people.
