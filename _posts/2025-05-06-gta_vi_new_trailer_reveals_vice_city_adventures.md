On the table, there are digital documents and holographic projectors displaying graphs and charts, while a stern pixelated character gestures dramatically as if leading the meeting. The lighting is bright and slightly garish, with neon colors illuminating the scene, creating a surreal atmosphere. Outside the window, a pixelated landscape can be seen, contrasting the mundane interior with hints of adventure beyond. The photographic style has a high-contrast, vivid quality that emphasizes the absurdity of the situation.")

The highly anticipated Grand Theft Auto VI has sparked widespread protests among gamers who claim the game's commitment to realism has gone too far, with players forced to attend mandatory Homeowners Association meetings before conducting any criminal activities.

The latest installment in the "Grand Theft Auto-cracy" franchise requires players to obtain proper permits, file paperwork, and sit through endless virtual community meetings before engaging in traditional gameplay elements like car theft and heists.

"I spent three hours trying to get approval to modify my safehouse's exterior paint color before I could even start my first mission," complained veteran player Mike Rodriguez. "The virtual red tape is worse than actual Miami."

Rockstar Games defended their decision, with a spokesperson stating: "We're proud to deliver the most authentic Vice City experience, complete with soul-crushing bureaucracy and arbitrary rules about lawn maintenance."

Local gaming forums are flooded with complaints about the new "Property Insurance Simulator" mechanic, which requires players to negotiate coverage rates before engaging in destructive behavior.

The developer has promised a future patch will reduce HOA meeting lengths from real-time to merely excruciating.
