![Alt Text](https://res.cloudinary.com/dfh1z3jos/image/upload/v1754229702/etnzt592njijotvk5q5f.jpg "A massive hall of mirrors where multiple identical Donald Trump figures in identical navy suits and red ties stand in every reflection, each striking a slightly different pompous pose. The Trumps are arranged in an infinite recursive pattern, with some leaning forward, some pointing, some with arms crossed, creating a dizzying visual of self-replication. The lighting is harsh and theatrical, with dramatic spotlights casting sharp shadows that intersect and overlap, emphasizing the surreal multiplication. The floor is a polished marble surface that reflects the Trumps even further, creating an overwhelming sense of narcissistic abundance. The photographic style is hyper-realistic with a slightly exaggerated, almost satirical edge, reminiscent of a surrealist portrait that exposes the subject's ego through visual metaphor.")

In an unprecedented move to resolve ongoing confirmation disputes with the Senate, former President Donald Trump has nominated himself for all 1,200 Senate-confirmed positions, creating what experts are calling a "Cabinet of mirrors."

"I'm the best candidate for every job because nobody knows Trump better than Trump," declared Trump while simultaneously interviewing himself for multiple positions. "I'll be Secretary of State in the morning, Treasury Secretary after lunch, and Defense Secretary for dinner. It's perfect, believe me."

Dr. Sigmund Fraud, leading political psychiatrist, expressed concern about the situation. "We're seeing the first recorded case of governmental multiple personality disorder. The executive branch has become a one-man show, quite literally."

Sally Singular, cabinet affairs analyst, noted the practical challenges: "We've had to install 1,200 golden mirrors in the West Wing so each Trump can consult with himself. The echo chamber is both literal and metaphorical."

The Senate remains deadlocked on how to proceed, as every confirmation hearing consists of Trump questioning himself while wearing different colored ties to distinguish between his roles.

"The only upside," noted Singular, "is that cabinet meetings now take just 30 seconds, as everyone instantly agrees with everyone else."
