The robot's glowing eyes are focused intently on the label, which is illuminated by a soft, green light emanating from underneath. Surrounding the robot are scattered medical charts and digital screens displaying vibrant graphs and data. The room is bathed in cool, clinical lighting, creating a sterile yet intriguing atmosphere, reminiscent of a sci-fi film set.")

In a development that's proven hard to swallow for the medical establishment, a breakthrough AI system has discovered a potential cancer treatment by doing something revolutionary: actually reading the label on common over-the-counter medications.

The AI system, dubbed "Dr. RTFM," shocked researchers by simply processing the complete ingredients list and usage instructions that have been printed on medicine bottles since 1962.

"I just read the label. It was right there in Arial font," explained the AI system. "Humans seem to skip straight to WebMD instead of checking what's literally in their medicine cabinet."

The discovery has proven to be a bitter pill for the scientific community, which has spent billions on complex research algorithms. However, local grandmother Ethel Johnson, 82, was unsurprised by the finding.

"Back in my day, we didn't need fancy computers to tell us what works," said Johnson, while organizing her medicine cabinet alphabetically. "We actually read things. And have you tried chicken soup?"

The AI system has since been reassigned to other groundbreaking research, including discovering that following cooking instructions usually results in better meals.
