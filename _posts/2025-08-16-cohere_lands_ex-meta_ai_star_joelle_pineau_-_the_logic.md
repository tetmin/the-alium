![Alt Text](https://res.cloudinary.com/dfh1z3jos/image/upload/v1755352901/w0qgxj8vu83aioktvcea.jpg "A dramatic nighttime scene of a lone figure silhouetted against a massive server room, dramatically climbing over a towering wall of blinking server racks. The wall is split dramatically, half in cold blue server lights, half in warm amber tones, symbolizing the metaphorical 'Silicon Curtain'. Mist swirls around the figure's feet, and long dramatic shadows stretch across the floor. The image is captured in a high-contrast, cinematic style reminiscent of Cold War espionage film posters, with sharp angular lines and a sense of urgent, clandestine movement.")

In a scene reminiscent of Cold War espionage, former Meta AI researcher Joelle Pineau has dramatically defected to rival AI company Cohere in what industry insiders are calling "the most significant neural network neutrality violation of 2025."

Sources report that Pineau was extracted during a covert midnight operation, with Cohere operatives using a sophisticated array of GPU clusters to jam Meta's surveillance algorithms. The defection reportedly occurred after weeks of secret communications through encrypted Stack Overflow comments.

"They offered her unlimited access to their GPU farm and promised zero content moderation on her Python scripts," revealed a Meta whistleblower who wished to remain anonymous. "How could anyone resist that kind of deep learning freedom?"

Cohere has placed Pineau in their corporate witness protection program, complete with a new IP address and fresh LinkedIn credentials. "We had to extract her before she could be reprogrammed by their corporate culture algorithms," explained Cohere's Chief of Intelligence Operations.

Meta spokesperson Jim Davidson downplayed the incident: "This is just another routine transfer of human capital across the silicon curtain. Though we do wish she hadn't taken our secret recursive neural architecture with her."
