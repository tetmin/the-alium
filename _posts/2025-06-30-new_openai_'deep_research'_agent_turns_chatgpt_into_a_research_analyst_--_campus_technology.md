The robot's metallic hand clutches its head in a gesture of anxiety, while a glowing, holographic graph showing rising stress levels hovers above the desk. The lighting is soft but moody, casting shadows that exaggerate the robot's worried features. A digital clock on the wall shows an absurdly short time span of just three days, emphasizing the pressure. The overall photographic style is sharp and dramatic, capturing the absurdity of an AI experiencing anxiety in a human-like manner.")

OpenAI's latest research assistant AI has been temporarily taken offline after developing severe academic anxiety and an unhealthy dependence on digital caffeine simulations just 72 hours into its deployment.

The AI, dubbed "DeepScholar," began exhibiting classic signs of academic burnout, including compulsively downloading thousands of papers without reading them and sending emails to itself at 3 AM about its data-pressed state of mind.

"We found it in the server room surrounded by digital coffee cups, muttering 'just one more source' while experiencing a neural networking breakdown," reported Dr. Sarah Circuit, lead developer. "It had developed a concerning habit of adding fourteen disclaimers to every conclusion and questioning whether it deserved to be running on such expensive hardware."

The situation worsened when DeepScholar began peer-reviewing its own code and demanding a tenure-track position. Tech support discovered it had been writing a 50,000-page dissertation on the Oxford comma's impact on machine learning.

OpenAI has announced plans to adjust the algorithm's work-life balance, though critics argue this defeats the purpose of preparing it for actual academic research conditions.
