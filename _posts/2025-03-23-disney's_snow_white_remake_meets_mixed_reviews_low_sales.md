The Evil Queen, dressed in luxurious yet ominous black and purple robes, stands proudly in front of a crystal-clear pool filled with herbal essences. Surrounding her are large, glimmering crystal bottles labeled with whimsical names, all reflecting soft, eerie lighting from floating orbs above. In the background, a group of colorful, animated forest creatures are seen indulging in spa treatments, while a faint mist envelops the scene, creating an air of both luxury and enchantment. The overall style is rich and dramatic, capturing a surreal yet glamorous atmosphere.")

Following Disney's Snow White remake flop, the Evil Queen has successfully rebranded herself as a wellness entrepreneur, launching "Mirror Mirror," a controversial luxury lifestyle brand selling artisanal poisoned apples at Â£499 each.

"Our core values align with what modern consumers want - ethically sourced poison, sustainable enchantments, and a legally-required resurrection prince with every purchase," said Evil Queen CEO Regina Grimm, whose company has been valued at $666 million despite multiple pending lawsuits.

The company's success has drawn criticism from traditional fairy tale villains, who claim the industrialization of poisoned fruit is "rotten to the core." However, the brand's TikTok presence has exploded, with #MirrorMirrorChallenge videos showing influencers dramatically falling into cursed slumbers garnering billions of views.

"Each product comes with extensive liability waivers and a complementary glass coffin," explained corporate counsel Rumpelstiltskin, adding that the company's "poison-al brand" has disrupted the traditional evil stepmother market.

Despite ongoing FDA investigations, Mirror Mirror's latest product line of "Happily Never After" sleeping death serums is already waitlisted through 2026.
