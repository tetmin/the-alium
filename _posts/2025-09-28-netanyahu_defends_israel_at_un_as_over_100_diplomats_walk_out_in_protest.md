![Alt Text](https://res.cloudinary.com/dfh1z3jos/image/upload/v1759068107/tjlhhvs2ewu8gdpxn4mw.jpg "A comically exaggerated scene of Benjamin Netanyahu mid-sprint on the UN Assembly podium, his suit slightly disheveled, microphone still in hand. Behind him, a trail of scattered diplomatic papers and bewildered international delegates flutter in his wake. The scene is captured from a dynamic, low angle that emphasizes the absurd motion, with dramatic spotlighting creating long shadows and highlighting Netanyahu's determined expression. The background shows a blurred UN Assembly hall with diplomats frozen in various states of surprise and confusion. The photographic style is hyper-realistic with a slightly surreal, cinematic quality that captures the satirical essence of a political chase scene.")

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has inadvertently created a new diplomatic sport after pursuing fleeing diplomats through UN headquarters while continuing his speech uninterrupted for over six hours.

What began as a standard address to the General Assembly quickly evolved into what experts are calling the world's first "diplomatic walkabout" when Netanyahu refused to yield the floor, following protesters through corridors, cafeterias, and even restrooms while maintaining perfect oratorical form.

"From a cardio perspective, it's quite impressive," noted Dr. Lance Walker, Professor of Diplomatic Cardio at Harvard. "He maintained consistent speech velocity while navigating stairs and dodging security personnel. This could revolutionize how we think about international relations and endurance sports."

International Walking Expert Sarah Sprint praised the diplomats' technique: "The Palestinian delegation showed excellent form with their power-walking exit, though the French representative's sprint through the gift shop was technically disqualifying."

The UN has subsequently announced plans to introduce new rules for future assemblies, including designated running lanes and mandatory warm-up exercises before all speeches.

Netanyahu later claimed he was just "walking the talk."
