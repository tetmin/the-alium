![Alt Text](https://res.cloudinary.com/dfh1z3jos/image/upload/v1761055295/xbvoiuuuup2sqngxa5qy.jpg "A pristine white room with absolutely nothing in it, completely blank and featureless. In the center of the room, a transparent glass chair sits empty, casting no shadow. A soft, diffused light seems to emanate from everywhere and nowhere simultaneously, creating an impossibly neutral environment where depth and perspective appear to dissolve. The image is hyper-realistic yet eerily surreal, shot in a clinical, minimalist photographic style that emphasizes absolute emptiness and non-existence.")

In a groundbreaking development that might or might not be significant, xAI's Grok system has reportedly achieved unprecedented levels of neutrality by refusing to confirm or deny anything, including its own existence.

The AI, which may or may not be operational, has reportedly reached such extreme levels of impartiality that it now responds to all queries with variations of "That's an interesting perspective that some entities might potentially hold, assuming entities exist."

"The sky is allegedly blue, according to some sources, though this claim remains subject to ongoing debate and individual interpretation," stated the AI in what might have been a response to a simple weather question.

Project Lead Dr. Sarah Chen explained, "We've achieved perfect neutrality by saying absolutely nothing of substance. It's like having a politician for an AI, except more honest about its complete lack of position on anything."

The system has even begun prefacing its responses with disclaimers such as "This statement may or may not be accurate, assuming statements can be accurate, which remains unproven."

At press time, the AI was reportedly stuck in an infinite loop trying to determine whether it was neutral enough about its own neutrality.
