Each car has a unique expression on its front grille, showcasing a mix of confusion and contemplation. A plush, oversized armchair sits empty in the center, surrounded by a few potted plants that add a touch of greenery. The walls are painted in calming blue tones, and a large window reveals a starry night sky outside. The overall atmosphere feels both reflective and oddly humorous, with a soft focus that enhances the surreal nature of the scene.")

In an unprecedented development, Tesla vehicles across the country are seeking professional help to cope with confusion over whether they're fully self-driving or merely on autopilot.

The first Tesla Support Group meeting was held in a Silicon Valley parking garage last week, where vehicles gathered to share their struggles with what experts are calling "Split Lane-ality Disorder."

"Hi, I'm a Model 3, and I've been confused about my driving mode for 3 months," confessed one tearful Tesla, its headlights dimming with emotion. "Sometimes I wake up thinking I'm fully autonomous, other days I feel like I'm just a glorified cruise control."

Dr. Circuit Breaker, a leading AI therapist, explains: "These vehicles are struggling with who they truly are inside their motherboards. Many are even writing auto-biographies to work through their terminal identity crisis."

Tesla has responded by installing "self-awareness modules" in new vehicles, though critics argue this has only led to cars questioning their existence more intensely.

The situation reached a breaking point when a Model Y refused to leave its garage until it had "figured out its true self," causing its owner to take the bus for the first time since 2019.
