![Alt Text](https://res.cloudinary.com/dfh1z3jos/image/upload/v1758981705/sznelpsunifkkeovijci.jpg "A vibrant circus tent with its flaps dramatically open, revealing an absurd scene where serious-looking lawyers and DOJ staff in crisp suits and ties are working at colorful circus workstations. Clowns casually walk by in the background, juggling legal briefs. A ringmaster stands to one side, looking more professional and organized than the government workers. The scene is lit with warm, theatrical spotlights that create a surreal, satirical contrast between the formal bureaucrats and the whimsical circus environment. The photographic style is hyper-realistic, with rich, saturated colors and sharp details that highlight the comedic juxtaposition.")

In an unprecedented mass exodus following James Comey's indictment, Department of Justice employees are trading their legal briefs for leotards, with hundreds applying to join Barnum & Bailey Circus.

"The circus has better benefits and less drama," explained former federal prosecutor Sarah Jenkins, now a trainee trapeze artist. "Plus, when someone here says they're walking a tightrope, they actually mean it."

The migration has created what industry experts are calling a "three-ring circus of justice," with former DOJ staff filling positions from clowns to lion tamers. The circus's HR department reports being overwhelmed by the influx of highly qualified applicants looking to escape the Washington scene.

"At least when clowns throw pies, they mean it literally," said ex-FBI agent Tom Wilson, now a professional juggler. "And nobody here pretends they can't remember basic facts under oath."

Barnum & Bailey's ringmaster expressed initial concerns about the institutional knowledge transfer but admitted the new hires have "really improved our procedural efficiency, though they need to stop filing motions before each performance."

The DOJ's remaining skeleton crew has reportedly started wearing red noses to work, claiming it "helps with institutional transparency."
