They are positioned in front of large, extravagant ring lights that cast a soft glow around them. One agent is dramatically adjusting the brightness on a massive ring light, while another checks their reflection in a nearby mirror, posing for a selfie. The third agent holds a smartphone, capturing the moment with a smirk. The setting is vibrant, with colorful decor and a playful, upbeat atmosphere, emphasizing the absurdity of government agents prioritizing social media aesthetics. The lighting is bright and flattering, creating a fun, engaging scene that pops visually.")

Immigration officers across the United States are demanding professional-grade lighting equipment and editing software after new regulations require them to become full-time content creators while processing visa applications.

The Department of Homeland Security's new "Immigration Reality" program transforms visa processing into what officials describe as "a cross between American Idol and a LinkedIn fever dream," with officers expected to maintain verified accounts across all major platforms.

"We're looking for applicants with authentic engagement, not bought followers," explained Chad Influence, Head of Immigration Metrics. "Yesterday I had to reject someone because their ratio was bad and they should feel bad."

The change has led to unexpected challenges, with many senior immigration officials struggling to maintain their content schedules. Border stations are now equipped with ring lights, green screens, and dedicated TikTok dance spaces, while "Immigration Reality" has become the number one streaming show on government servers.

"It's exhausting," admitted one Feed-eral agent, speaking on condition of anonymity. "I spent six hours yesterday trying to make a visa rejection video go viral. The applicant's crime? Using Comic Sans in their Instagram bio."
