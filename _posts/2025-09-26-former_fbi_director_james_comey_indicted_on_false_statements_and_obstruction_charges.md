![Alt Text](https://res.cloudinary.com/dfh1z3jos/image/upload/v1758895299/zhy6aaaggp0kg2bkbu9j.jpg "A massive medical quarantine tent filled with giant, mutating speech bubbles shaped like twisted, viral-looking text clouds. In the center, a cartoonish representation of James Comey stands wearing a CDC hazmat suit, holding a giant red warning sign and looking bewildered. Microscopic lying-related particles swirl around him like infectious agents, glowing with an eerie, sickly green bioluminescence. The scene is captured in a dramatic documentary-style photography with harsh, clinical lighting that emphasizes the absurdity of the 'viral lie' metaphor. The background shows blurry CDC researchers frantically tracking the spread of these mutating speech formations on oversized medical charts.")

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has declared a national emergency following the unprecedented spread of falsehoods emanating from former FBI Director James Comey, with early estimates suggesting his lies are reproducing at a rate that makes COVID look like a common cold.

"We're seeing an R-number of approximately 47," explained Dr. Truth Serum, Chief Honesty Officer at the CDC. "One Comey fabrication enters a room and within minutes, everyone's claiming they invented Post-it notes or dated Taylor Swift."

The highly infectious untruths have already forced the evacuation of three federal buildings, with symptoms including spontaneous resume enhancement and an irresistible urge to claim Canadian citizenship. The FBI has been particularly hard hit, with agents now referring to themselves as "Fabricating Better Investigations."

"At this point, he's lying about lying," noted Sarah Verity from the Department of Accuracy. "Yesterday he claimed he'd never even heard of the FBI and that he's actually three children in a trench coat."

The CDC recommends maintaining at least six feet of distance from any Comey statements and wearing industrial-strength fact-checking masks when exposed to federal testimony.
