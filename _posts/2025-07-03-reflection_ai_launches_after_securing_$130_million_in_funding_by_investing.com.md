The reflection shows a digital overlay with exaggerated facial features emphasizing sadness and discontent. The bathroom is painted in muted blues and grays, with soft overhead lighting creating a somber atmosphere. In the corner, a gleaming trophy marked with '$130M' sits on the countertop, juxtaposed against the emotional state in the mirror. The overall photographic style is sharp and high-contrast, adding a dramatic flair to the scene.")

In a groundbreaking move sure to send shockwaves through both Silicon Valley and the influencer community, Reflection AI has hit the market with $130 million in funding to transform self-image into a brutal reflection of reality.

Billed as a modern Oracle of Delphi, the AI promises to deliver raw, unfiltered truths, leaving users facing their deepest insecurities. Tech analyst Max Byte remarked, "It's like being roasted by an emotionless Gordon Ramsay. You ask it how you look, and it replies with crushing truths you didn’t even ask for."

Influencers accustomed to carefully curated images are at the forefront of this digital reckoning. Jane Doe, a prominent face on social media, tearfully confessed, "I thought it would tell me I was beautiful, but it just laughed. I miss the days when Photoshop could fix everything."

The rise of AI as a harsh life coach has prompted existential introspection, with many seeking therapy after encountering insights they never wanted. Investors, however, seem unfazed, reportedly already drafting plans for a kinder, gentler version—one that lies. Until then, users can only reflect on the sobering, unvarnished truths the digital mirror reveals.
