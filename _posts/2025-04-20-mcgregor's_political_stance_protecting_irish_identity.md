The background is filled with swirling green smoke and clovers, creating an enchanting atmosphere. The leprechaun's expression is fierce and determined, with a glint of mischief in his eye. Bright, dramatic spotlights beam down onto the ring, casting sharp shadows and enhancing the scene's intensity. The overall photographic style is vibrant and dynamic, capturing the energy of a high-stakes fight night.")

UFC star Conor McGregor has unveiled a controversial new system for verifying Irish identity, requiring citizens to compete in a series of increasingly difficult cultural challenges to maintain their "Celtic Credentials."

The program, dubbed "Fighting Irish-ntity," ranks individuals on a scale from "Tourist" to "Top O' The Morning," based on criteria including ability to river dance while throwing punches, Guinness consumption speed, and proper use of the phrase "grand altogether."

"We're simply protecting our heritage through combat sports," explained Dr. Paddy O'Statistics, head of Heritage Authentication at McGregor's newly established Institute of Aggressive Identity. "If you can't recite your family tree while defending against a rear naked choke hold, are you even Irish?"

The system has faced criticism after several elderly Dublin residents were stripped of their Irish status for failing to perform traditional sword dancing while reciting James Joyce's "Ulysses" in its entirety.

DNA expert Sean O'Science raised concerns: "McGregor's insistence that 'true Irish' blood glows green under UV light suggests a fundamental misunderstanding of basic biology."

McGregor defended his program, stating: "The real question is: if you're not willing to fight for your heritage, did you ever really have it?"
