The beds are arranged in a strict grid, visibly decreasing in quality and comfort from left to right, with the most dilapidated and cramped accommodations on the far right side. A giant, glowing cursor hovers over the scene, positioned next to a 'Price: Highest First' dropdown menu, casting a cold, blue-white digital light that highlights the stark economic hierarchy of the living spaces. The photographic style is high-contrast documentary, with a slightly desaturated color palette that emphasizes the clinical, bureaucratic nature of the scene.")

The Home Office has admitted that a catastrophic £15.3 billion overspend on asylum seeker accommodation occurred after a junior staff member accidentally left Booking.com's 'Sort by Price: Highest First' filter activated for three years.

The error has resulted in thousands of asylum seekers being housed in presidential suites across Britain's most exclusive hotels, while MPs are forced to share cramped offices in the crumbling Houses of Parliament.

"We meant to book Travelodge, not The Ritz," explained red-faced Home Office spokesperson Janet Phillips. "Unfortunately, by the time we noticed the error, the asylum seekers had already accumulated enough loyalty points to achieve lifetime platinum status."

The situation has sparked outrage among MPs, who now face the indignity of watching asylum seekers enjoy complimentary spa treatments through the windows of their asbestos-filled offices.

"The spa facilities are fully booked until 2026," confirmed Sebastian Worthington-Smythe, manager of The Dorchester. "We've had to hire additional butlers just to handle the room service requests for caviar and champagne."

The Home Office has promised to rectify the situation, just as soon as they figure out how to cancel 10,000 non-refundable bookings made through Booking.com.
