In the center of the arena, a grand podium is set up, where oversized, anthropomorphic representations of economic indicators, like a giant inflation graph and a GDP bar chart, shake hands with representatives from various political parties. Bright, vibrant colors dominate the scene, with flashing lights and confetti falling from above, creating a festive atmosphere. The lighting is dynamic and dramatic, capturing the excitement of a live sports event, while a large scoreboard overhead displays fluctuating numbers in real-time. The overall photographic style is lively and energetic, echoing the thrill of a draft day celebration.")

In an unprecedented development, economic statistics have gained sentience and are now choosing political parties to represent, leaving economists scrambling to make sense of what they're calling a "statistical civil war."

The GDP growth rate, traditionally a neutral indicator, has signed a four-year deal with the Democrats, while unemployment figures have inked a lucrative contract with the Republicans, complete with performance bonuses for negative interpretation rights.

"We're seeing numbers behaving like professional athletes during free agency," explains Dr. Alan Count, Professor of Partisan Mathematics at Electoral University. "The inflation rate is currently a restricted free agent, entertaining offers from both sides but leaning Republican."

The crisis peaked during yesterday's economic briefing when the Consumer Price Index stormed off the statistical chart, refusing to be analyzed by the opposing party's economists.

"We need a return to bipartisan mathematics," argues James Decimal, the newly-appointed Number Mediator. "These statistics are acting like it's March Madness, picking sides and forming brackets. Yesterday, I caught the trade deficit numbers practicing their Democratic spin moves."

The Federal Reserve has announced plans to establish a transfer window for economic indicators, though critics argue this will only further politicize the already divided data set.
