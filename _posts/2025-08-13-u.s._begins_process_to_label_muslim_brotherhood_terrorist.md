![Alt Text](https://res.cloudinary.com/dfh1z3jos/image/upload/v1755093754/tb9z9tljrpo24rojkl52.jpg "A surreal courtroom scene where a large, cartoonish TV set with 'Big Brother' logo sits in the defendant's chair, wearing an orange prison jumpsuit and handcuffs. Government officials in dark suits look bewildered, with oversized official stamps and paperwork scattered around. The room has an exaggerated, fisheye lens perspective, creating a sense of absurd bureaucratic chaos. Harsh fluorescent lighting casts sharp shadows, emphasizing the comedic confusion of mistaken identity. The entire scene has a slightly desaturated, documentary-style photographic quality that heightens the satirical bureaucratic mix-up.")

In a bureaucratic blunder that has reality TV executives scrambling, the U.S. government's sweeping initiative to label brotherhood organizations as terrorist groups has accidentally designated the Big Brother television show as an "immediate threat to national security."

The error occurred when an overzealous intern at the newly-created Department of Brotherhood Security flagged any organization containing the word "brother" in its name. The ban has already affected dozens of innocent groups, creating what officials are calling "a family reunion gone terribly wrong."

"Next thing you know, they'll label the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers as train terrorists," warned Transportation Secretary Tom Williams, while nervously eyeing a passing Amtrak train. "We've already had to detain three Christian Brothers wine merchants and the entire Brotherhood of Traveling Pants book club."

Marcel Silence, leader of the Brotherhood of Mime Artists, expressed his opposition through an elaborate series of gestures that federal agents interpreted as "highly suspicious activity."

The Department of Brotherhood Security has announced plans to review all cases, but warns the process could take years due to their new 47,000-page "Brother, Where Art Thou Security Clearance?" application form.
