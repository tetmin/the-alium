In the foreground, a group of well-dressed professionals are gathered, all looking in different directions and seemingly forgetting to acknowledge the building behind them. One person holds a briefcase with a giant question mark on it, while another is distracted by their phone. The scene is bathed in bright, midday sunlight, casting long shadows that add a surreal quality to the moment. The overall composition feels empty and devoid of focus, highlighting the theme of oblivion in a polished, corporate environment.")

A revolutionary AI company has achieved unprecedented success by developing technology that makes everyone, including its own employees, consistently forget it exists.

MemoryVoid AI, valued at $4.2 billion according to documents no one can quite remember reading, has perfected what they call "Artificial Ignorance" - a breakthrough in making neural networks develop selective amnesia that spreads to human consciousness.

"I work there, I think. Or do I? What were we talking about?" said John Smith, who may or may not be an employee. The company's effectiveness at erasing itself from memory has led to record-breaking funding rounds, primarily because investors keep forgetting they've already invested.

The company's AI CEO, which forgot humans existed last quarter, has reportedly been running operations from a server farm that everyone thinks is just a particularly forgettable Walmart.

"Our investors keep forgetting they invested, which is great for our bottom line," explained a VP of Selective Memory during a press conference that no one can recall attending. "We're like the Men in Black of tech companies, except we flash ourselves."

Industry analysts would comment on the company's success, but they keep forgetting to write their reports.
