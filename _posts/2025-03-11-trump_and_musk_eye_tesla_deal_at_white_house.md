![Alt Text](https://res.cloudinary.com/dfh1z3jos/image/upload/v1741728672/vtnwav0fgb7bc5mywcn3.jpg "A flamboyant supervillain, combining elements of Donald Trump and Elon Musk, stands triumphantly atop a futuristic skyscraper. The character has exaggerated features, with a wild mane of electric-blue hair and a suit that shimmers like chrome, adorned with glowing circuit patterns. In one hand, they hold a lightning bolt-shaped scepter that crackles with energy, while the other gestures dramatically toward a skyline dotted with Tesla-like flying cars. Dark storm clouds swirl overhead, illuminated by flashes of bright lightning, casting a dramatic and ominous glow over the scene. The photographic style captures every detail in high contrast, with an emphasis on sharp lines and vibrant colors to enhance the larger-than-life presence of the supervillain.")

In a shocking development that scientists are calling "the most powerful narcissistic fusion ever recorded," Donald Trump and Elon Musk have announced plans to merge their empires, personalities, and hair plugs into a single entity.

The unprecedented fusion, occurring at the White House's newly installed Gigafactory, will create what insiders are calling the world's first "ego-lectric" supervillain. The merger promises to revolutionize the way megalomaniacs operate by combining Trump's ability to never admit defeat with Musk's talent for tanking stocks with single tweets.

"The electrical potential of their combined egos could power the entire Eastern seaboard," explains Dr. Ego Merger, Harvard's Professor of Narcissism Studies. "We're seeing levels of self-importance that shouldn't even be possible."

The new entity, temporarily dubbed "Trelon Mrusk," has already announced plans for "Making America Gigafactory Again" and replacing all government vehicles with gold-plated Cybertrucks featuring Truth Social integration.

Bob Voltage, Power Dynamic Analyst, warns: "The real concern isn't the merger itself - it's that the resulting ego might develop its own gravitational pull and start attracting smaller narcissists into its orbit."

The merger is expected to complete once they figure out whose name should go first on the paperwork.
