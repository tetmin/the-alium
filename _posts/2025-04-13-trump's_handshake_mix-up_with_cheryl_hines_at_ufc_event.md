Bright, colorful lights illuminate the octagon, while the crowd, a mix of confused and amused faces, holds up signs with Larry David's name and iconic quotes. In the foreground, a security guard stares at a malfunctioning facial recognition tablet displaying a glitchy grid of Larry David's face overlaying the images of various attendees. The scene is vibrant with high contrast, capturing the chaotic energy of the event and the absurdity of the situation.")

Former President Donald Trump's internal facial recognition software experienced a catastrophic malfunction at Saturday's UFC event, resulting in him mistaking every celebrity in attendance for various cast members of Curb Your Enthusiasm.

The hands-down confusion reached its peak when Trump enthusiastically greeted actress Cheryl Hines as "Larry, my favorite Jewish comedian" before launching into an impromptu pitch for a Curb episode about election fraud.

"He kept calling me Julia Louis-Dreyfus and asking about Seinfeld," reported a visibly confused Hines. "When I corrected him, he insisted I was being pretty, pretty, pretty difficult."

Dr. Theodore Shakesman, Professor of Handshake Studies at Harvard, explains: "We're seeing a complete breakdown in Mr. Trump's celebrity identification circuits. It's the worst case of Famous Person Confusion Syndrome I've encountered since Gerald Ford mistook the entire Chinese ping-pong team for Henry Kissinger."

The evening concluded with Trump attempting to book Dana White on Palestinian Chicken 2, apparently convinced the UFC president was the producer of HBO's hit comedy series.
