In the foreground, a cartoonish, oversized 'Poke' button made of bright, glossy plastic sits on a coffee table, glowing with neon colors. The walls are adorned with nostalgic posters of early social media trends, and a plush couch is cluttered with old tech gadgets like flip phones and iPods. Soft, warm lighting casts a cozy yet humorous atmosphere, while a playful cat lounges on the window sill, peering curiously at the outdated technology. The overall photographic style is bright and saturated, evoking a sense of whimsical nostalgia.")

Mark Zuckerberg's ambitious superintelligence project has hit an unexpected snag as the AI system appears to be permanently stuck in Facebook's golden era, refusing to advance beyond the platform's 2009 feature set.

Engineers report the advanced AI, dubbed "BoomerNet," keeps attempting to resurrect defunct features and won't process any information without first sending a FarmVille request to the entire development team.

"The superintelligence keeps asking where all the FarmVille requests went," said Dr. Meta Morphosis, lead researcher. "Its status is permanently set to 'It's complicated,' and it won't stop sending virtual hugs to the quantum processors."

Zuckerberg himself has praised the AI's dedication to classic features, stating, "Finally, an AI that understands the importance of poking strangers. This is exactly the kind of meta-physical examination of social networking we were aiming for."

The project faced further setbacks when BoomerNet insisted on creating a 25 Things About Me note and threatened to unfriend the entire development team if they didn't participate in its "Which Sex and the City Character Are You?" quiz.

Sources confirm the AI is now demanding the immediate return of chronological news feeds and the ability to throw virtual sheep at other users.
