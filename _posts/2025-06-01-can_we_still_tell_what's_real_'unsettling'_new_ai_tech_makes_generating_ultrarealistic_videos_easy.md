![Alt Text](https://res.cloudinary.com/dfh1z3jos/image/upload/v1748786543/muo0ejilucxytc3jfoy3.jpg "A man sits at a cluttered desk in a dimly lit room, surrounded by an array of technological gadgets and screens displaying various complex algorithms. He has a look of intense concentration on his face, with sweat beads forming on his forehead as he nervously types on a vintage typewriter, surrounded by crumpled paper and coffee cups. The soft glow of a single desk lamp casts dramatic shadows, highlighting the manâ€™s facial features and the chaotic environment. A digital clock in the background ominously ticks away the time, emphasizing the long hours spent in this surreal battle against the perception of artificiality. The overall photographic style is gritty and candid, capturing a moment of existential struggle.")

Local man Tom Jenkins spent six exhausting hours yesterday attempting to prove to himself and others that he isn't just an ultra-realistic AI-generated video simulation.

The crisis began when Jenkins watched a demonstration of new AI video technology and realized he couldn't definitively prove he wasn't himself a sophisticated digital creation. His subsequent existential meltdown included pinching himself repeatedly and asking colleagues to verify his childhood memories.

"The reality patch notes clearly state that humans should be able to distinguish themselves from AI," said Dr. Reality Check, head of Existential Computing at the Institute of Digital Philosophy. "But we're seeing an increasing number of people requiring authentication updates."

Professional Human Authenticator Karen Actual reports a 500% increase in reality verification requests. "Yesterday, a client insisted on bleeding to prove he wasn't binary code. I had to explain that AI can now simulate blood quite convincingly."

Jenkins has since started carrying a card stating "I think, therefore I am probably real," but admits he's not entirely sure if he wrote it himself or if an AI wrote it while pretending to be him pretending to be real.
