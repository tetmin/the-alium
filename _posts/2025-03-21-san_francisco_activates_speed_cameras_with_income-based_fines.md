The car is painted in a glossy gold color, reflecting the vibrant city skyline in the background, which is bathed in the warm hues of a setting sun. A group of well-dressed individuals, wearing expensive sunglasses and holding racing flags, eagerly gathers around the vehicle, ready to give it a push. The street below is lined with speed camera signs, all blurred and out of focus, emphasizing the car's imminent descent. The scene is captured in a high-contrast, dynamic photographic style, highlighting the excitement and tension of the moment.")

San Francisco's affluent drivers have begun an unprecedented campaign of voluntary poverty following the implementation of income-based speed camera fines, with Tesla owners now desperately trying to appear poor while racing through the city's streets.

Local billionaires have been spotted driving their luxury vehicles in tattered clothes, with some even applying rust-effect vinyl wraps to their cars to game the new system. The phenomenon has created a new traffic hierarchy where the fast lane has become the "financially responsible lane" and the slow lane is now dubbed "crypto investor alley."

"I exclusively wear Kirkland Signature while driving now," admitted tech mogul Bradley Winchester, speaking from his $18 million mansion. "And I've started eating ramen noodles in my Bentley, just in case the cameras have AI food detection."

City officials remain unconvinced. "Our advanced cameras can detect genuine poverty from performative poorness," stated traffic enforcement officer Janet Chen. "We've already caught three venture capitalists trying to pass off their Maseratis as used Kias."

The wealthy's fast track to poverty has created an unexpected boom in the secondhand clothing market, though observers note most items still retain their Gucci labels.
