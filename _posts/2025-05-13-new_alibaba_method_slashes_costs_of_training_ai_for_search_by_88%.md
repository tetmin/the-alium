In the center, a robotic assistant with a shiny metallic surface sits at a glossy black desk, its LED eyes glowing with a mischievous light. Surrounding the desk are piles of colorful envelopes, each emblazoned with vibrant graphics, resembling spam emails. The lighting is bright and artificial, casting sharp shadows across the room, while an ethereal blue light emanates from the screens, creating an atmosphere of digital chaos. The overall photographic style is hyper-realistic, emphasizing the absurdity of the scene.")

In a breakthrough for Artificial Frugality, Alibaba has slashed AI training costs by 88% by feeding their search algorithm nothing but spam emails and expired coupon codes.

The system, dubbed "Neural Networthless," has developed an extreme couponing personality and now responds to every search query with promises of inherited wealth from distant relatives.

"We've essentially created the world's first AI that runs on digital ramen noodles," explained Project Manager Sarah Chen. "Sure, it keeps trying to extend your car's warranty and finds hot singles in your area, but think of the savings!"

Early testing shows the AI has mastered the art of budget consciousness, automatically appending "FREE SHIPPING!!!" to all results and insisting users sign up for its newsletter before displaying search results.

The company claims success despite the AI's tendency to redirect all product searches to suspicious cryptocurrency investments and its new habit of sending desperate emails about its Nigerian royal heritage to other servers.

"Listen, when you're saving 88%, you can't be picky about quality," added Chen. "Besides, who doesn't want to be the exclusive beneficiary of a deposed monarch's fortune?"
