![Alt Text](https://res.cloudinary.com/dfh1z3jos/image/upload/v1759845698/nzdnpo5w0fdp3ryhw5ty.jpg "A modern government office transformed into a medieval marketplace, with federal workers in business casual attire trading office supplies, lunch items, and documents like precious commodities. Staplers, half-eaten sandwiches, and manila folders are exchanged across makeshift wooden stalls draped with bureaucratic banners. Fluorescent overhead lighting casts a harsh, slightly surreal glow on the scene, highlighting the absurd desperation of workers bartering paperclips for coffee and printer ink. The photographic style is documentary-like, with a slightly desaturated color palette that emphasizes the bureaucratic grimness of the improvised economic system.")

As the government shutdown enters its second week, federal employees have established an intricate bartering system reminiscent of medieval times, complete with its own marketplace on the National Mall.

The impromptu Federal Flea Market, as it's been dubbed, sees essential workers trading everything from policy drafts to parking permits. The Department of Agriculture is reportedly accepting livestock as payment, while the Pentagon has established a complex defense contract system based entirely on trading baseball cards.

"I traded three executive orders for a sandwich yesterday," admitted Tom Johnson, EPA Administrator. "The cafeteria staff won't accept promises of future budget allocations anymore."

The situation has grown increasingly medieval, with the Supreme Court now accepting payment in goats and the Treasury Department establishing exchange rates for various office supplies. "I'm personally accepting interpretive dance as payment for medical consultations," explained Dr. Janet Chen, Surgeon General. "It's actually working better than our previous system."

Congressional leaders remain deadlocked in negotiations, though sources report several representatives have been spotted trading their votes for premium spots at the Federal Flea Market's popular "Bureaucratic Bargains" section.
