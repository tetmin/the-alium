A politician in a tailored suit, with a slightly confused expression, sits in a plush chair, holding a quill and gazing thoughtfully at a dreamcatcher hanging above the desk, which is adorned with various whimsical trinkets. The room is bathed in soft, warm light, creating a cozy yet surreal atmosphere, with pastel colors dominating the decor. In the background, a large window shows a dreamy, starry night sky. The photographic style is slightly dreamy, with a soft focus on the edges to enhance the whimsical feeling.")

In a groundbreaking shift in economic policy-making, VP Vance and rival economist Bonchie have begun submitting their dream journals to Congress as proof of economic competence.

The new requirement comes after both leaders claimed their economic visions came to them in their sleep. "I saw a bull market literally running through my bedroom," insisted Vance, while Bonchie reported recurring dreams of dancing interest rates wearing top hats.

"These night-time economic revelations are actually quite common among policy makers," explains Dr. Sigmund Finance, the newly-appointed Head of Dream Economics at the Federal Reserve. "Last week, Janet Snoozen had a breakthrough when she dreamed about inflation wearing a jet pack."

The Treasury Department has now installed sleep pods in their offices, hoping to increase productive economic visions. However, critics argue that some politicians are just taking naps to avoid actual work.

"We're banking on dreams to fix the dream deficit," admitted one anonymous staffer, who reportedly dozed off during the interview while mumbling about fiscal nightmares and cryptocurrency sheep.
