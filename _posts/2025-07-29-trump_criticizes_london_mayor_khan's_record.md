![Alt Text](https://res.cloudinary.com/dfh1z3jos/image/upload/v1753797697/yqhiebd1iyeundhinggu.jpg "A massive, comically oversized vinyl record collection sprawls across an elegant London office, with records dramatically spilling onto the floor. Donald Trump, wearing an exaggerated frown and bright red tie, stands in the foreground pointing dramatically at the disorganized collection, his hand gesturing with an almost cartoonish sense of disapproval. The records are a chaotic mix of sizes and colors, some cracked and bent, while ornate British political portraits hang slightly askew in the background. The scene is lit with harsh, dramatic lighting that creates stark shadows, emphasizing the theatrical nature of Trump's critique. The photographic style is hyper-realistic with a slightly satirical, almost cinematic edge that captures the absurdity of the moment.")

Former President Donald Trump has launched a scathing attack on London Mayor Sadiq Khan's vinyl record collection, declaring it "the worst in political history, maybe ever."

In a blistering critique posted on Truth Social, Trump claimed Khan's musical taste showed his inability to lead, pointing out the mayor's "totally mainstream collection" and "complete lack of rare pressings."

"He doesn't even own 'The Art of the Deal' on vinyl," Trump complained. "I released it as a limited edition picture disc in '87. Beautiful album, many people say the best pressing ever."

Music critic and political analyst Dr. James Groove noted, "Trump keeps spinning these tales, but he's becoming a broken record. Though I must admit, Khan's collection is mostly mainstream hits, no deep cuts."

The former president went on to challenge Khan to a DJ battle at Madison Square Garden, promising to "make turntables great again" while criticizing the mayor's "weak mixing skills" and "sad inability to scratch."

Khan responded by pointing out that Trump's own record collection consists entirely of Kiss albums and bootleg recordings of his own speeches set to elevator music.
