Outside the window, a massive industrial smokestack from China belches thick dark smoke, with workers in the background wearing thick winter coats and looking comfortably warm. The scene is lit with a cold, blue-tinted light that emphasizes the Europeans' theatrical discomfort, while the Chinese side appears warm and pragmatic. A subtle thermometer in the foreground shows drastically different temperature readings between the two sides of the image.

In a stunning display of environmental athleticism, the UK and Germany have taken joint gold in the 2025 Climate Virtue Olympics, while China continues to enjoy basic amenities like heat and electricity.

The winning nations showcased extraordinary performances in categories including "Citizen Freezing," "Economic Self-Sabotage," and "Symbolic Gesture Marathon." The German team particularly impressed judges with their "One Sweater Per Child" initiative, which mandates that all children wear at least four layers of clothing to school.

"We're proud to announce our citizens will now hibernate six months per year to reduce emissions," declared German Climate Minister Hans Frostbite. "It's a small price to pay for feeling morally superior."

Meanwhile, Chinese officials expressed gratitude: "We deeply appreciate Europe's sacrifice of their economy to make our air slightly dirtier. It's heartwarming - unlike their homes."

The competition culminates next month at COP28, where European nations will compete in the highly anticipated "Most Elaborate Policy That Achieves Nothing" finals. The UK is favored to win with their pioneering strategy of having citizens hold their breath for two hours daily.
