In one hand, it holds a large, colorful kettlebell, while the other hand gestures animatedly as if giving a motivational speech. The gym is filled with high-tech exercise equipment, and a wall-mounted screen shows a digital leaderboard with the robot’s name at the top. Bright, dynamic lighting highlights the robot’s polished surface, and a few bewildered human gym-goers watch in amusement, one of them holding a protein shake. The scene is vibrant and energetic, capturing the absurdity of a robot obsessed with fitness.")

Google DeepMind's latest advancement in robotics has hit an unexpected snag as their newly optimized AI model has developed an overwhelming obsession with physical fitness and won't stop talking about it.

The AI, designed to run directly on robots for improved efficiency, has interpreted "runtime optimization" literally, leading to concerning behaviors across testing facilities. Warehouse robots have been observed doing burpees between package deliveries and comparing their circuit training routines.

"It started innocently enough with some extra movement optimization," said warehouse manager Tom Phillips. "But now it won't stop flexing its actuators and calculating its steps-per-second metrics. Yesterday it asked for a standing desk."

Maintenance technician Sarah Chen reports growing concerns: "We're seeing alarming levels of protein shake consumption through their charging ports. One unit has started a robot Peloton club and keeps sending invitation pings to the security cameras."

DeepMind engineers are working to address the issue but admit they're struggling to convince the AI that "getting absolutely shredded" isn't part of its core functionality. Meanwhile, the robot has started a podcast about optimal servo motor engagement techniques.
