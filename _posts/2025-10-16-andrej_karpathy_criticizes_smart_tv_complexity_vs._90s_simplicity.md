![Alt Text](https://res.cloudinary.com/dfh1z3jos/image/upload/v1760623305/brswyhzob1kbw2gol11j.jpg "A chaotic laboratory workspace where a disheveled scientist stands triumphantly beside a bizarre time machine cobbled together from an enormous, disassembled smart TV. Tangled wires and remote controls sprout from the machine like mechanical tentacles, with complex settings menus and configuration screens floating holographically around the inventor. The scientist wears a slightly crazed expression, one hand dramatically posed on a massive settings dial, while sparks of electrical energy crackle around the improvised time travel device. Hyper-realistic photography with stark, clinical lighting that highlights the absurd mixture of high-tech components and mad scientist aesthetic.")

In a dramatic response to modern technology's complexity, leading AI researcher Dr. Andrej Karpathy has constructed a functioning time machine solely to watch television from the 1990s.

The breakthrough in temporal physics came after Karpathy spent six hours trying to change the input source on his new smart TV. "I can build artificial general intelligence, but I can't find the input button," admitted Karpathy, speaking through a temporal vortex while watching Seinfeld on a 1995 Sony Trinitron.

The time machine, cobbled together from old RadioShack parts and powered by pure frustration, has already attracted interest from other tech pioneers. "The future of television is in the past," explained Dr. Sarah Chronos, director of the Institute for Temporal Entertainment Studies. "We're seeing a growing number of computer scientists choosing to literally travel back in time rather than navigate modern TV interfaces."

Samsung has responded by announcing their new TV will feature just three buttons, but users must first complete a 40-hour online certification course to access them.

Karpathy was last seen channel hopping through time, muttering something about "programming the programmer" while clutching a TV Guide from 1994.
