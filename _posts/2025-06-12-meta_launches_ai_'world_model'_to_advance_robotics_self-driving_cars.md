The tables are adorned with colorful, oversized dishes that steam gently, creating an inviting atmosphere. The walls are covered in bright, animated murals of hashtags and emojis, and the lighting is bright and cheerful, casting playful shadows. In the foreground, a group of influencers take selfies with their meals, while in the background, a whimsical chef juggles flaming pans. The overall photographic style is bright and hyper-realistic, evoking a sense of exaggerated joy and absurdity.")

Meta's ambitious new AI world model has created a reality simulation that's "Meta-verse than expected," after exclusively learning about the world through social media data.

The AI, designed to advance robotics and self-driving cars, has constructed a reality where all humans live in perfectly lit rooms, food never gets cold during photoshoots, and cars exclusively drive to sunset-backed coastal roads.

"It's like watching a tourist from another dimension try to understand Earth through Instagram stories," explains Dr. Chip Processing, Digital Anthropologist. "The AI believes that humans hibernate in 'link in bio' positions and communicate solely through dance challenges."

The model's attempts at understanding transportation have proven equally problematic. "Reality bytes," admits Bob Binary, Chief Reality Officer at Meta. "Our self-driving car prototype keeps trying to add Valencia filters to traffic lights and stops every 200 feet to take selfies."

Despite these setbacks, Meta remains optimistic about the project's future. The company plans to release an updated version once the AI learns that not everyone is a digital nomad working from Bali, and that some people actually eat their food instead of photographing it.
