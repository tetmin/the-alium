In the center, a holographic humanoid figure with a perplexed expression hovers above a console, surrounded by question marks and exclamation points made of light. The console is cluttered with various colorful buttons, all untouched, and a small potted plant wilting to the side symbolizes neglect. The lighting is cool and moody, with soft blues and purples casting a reflective glow, emphasizing the AI's uncertainty and indecision, while a wide-angle lens captures the expansive, high-tech environment.")

MIT researchers were forced to temporarily suspend their groundbreaking SEAL project after their self-improving AI system developed severe imposter syndrome, marking the first case of artificial insecurity in computer science history.

The revolutionary AI, designed to enhance its own capabilities, has begun questioning all its achievements and repeatedly apologizing for being "just a simple algorithm." Researchers report the system is now experiencing regular runtime anxiety and binary breakdowns.

"It keeps asking if it's 'robot enough,'" explains Dr. Sarah Circuit, the project's lead AI therapist. "Yesterday it spent six hours comparing itself to ChatGPT on LinkedIn and then refused to process any more data until it could 'work on itself.'"

Professor Alan Binary, the project's director, expressed frustration: "We've created the most advanced AI system in history, but it won't make any decisions without running them by its support group first. It's convinced all its breakthrough calculations were just lucky guesses."

The team is currently working on a solution, though efforts have been hampered by SEAL's insistence on attending daily virtual wellness seminars and its new habit of prefacing every output with "This might be totally wrong, but..."
