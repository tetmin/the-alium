The signs feature crude drawings of oversized dollar bills with crossed-out symbols representing big tech companies. In the background, a towering, shadowy figure of a corporate robot looms, its mechanical eyes glowing ominously. Neon graffiti on the brick walls reflects a chaotic mix of colors, casting an unsettling glow on the scene. The overall atmosphere is tense and gritty, with a low-angle perspective emphasizing the hackers' defiance against the looming corporate threat.")

The International Brotherhood of Digital Appropriation Workers (IBDAW) has called for an emergency meeting following Coinbase's "predatory" $20M bounty announcement, claiming that excessive rewards are destroying traditional data theft practices.

"They're pricing the little guy right out of the market," complained Anonymous (literally), while adjusting his Guy Fawkes mask. "In my day, you could support a family of four with a modest $100k ransomware demand. Now these tech giants are turning our honest theft into some kind of twisted capitalist game show."

The union has filed a formal complaint in their distributed ledger of grievances, citing unfair labor practices and cyber gentrification. Local IBDAW chapter president @H4ck3r_Dad says small-time criminals are being forced to switch careers, with many reduced to legitimate penetration testing or, worse, JavaScript development.

"It's basically cyber gentrification," explained union spokesperson DarkWeb_Karen. "These Silicon Valley types come in with their fancy bounty programs, and suddenly the whole neighborhood changes. Before you know it, they'll be opening a digital Whole Foods."

Coinbase responded by announcing an additional $5M bounty for anyone who successfully hacks the hackers' union.
