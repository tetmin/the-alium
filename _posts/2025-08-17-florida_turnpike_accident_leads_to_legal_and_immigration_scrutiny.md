![Alt Text](https://res.cloudinary.com/dfh1z3jos/image/upload/v1755439299/c1olxzgk5ewvcfqdkss0.jpg "A long stretch of Florida highway transforms into a living, anthropomorphic road with surveillance cameras for eyes and border checkpoint-style gates sprouting from its asphalt surface. The road has a stern, authoritarian demeanor, with its lane markings looking like crisp uniform lines and its shoulders standing at attention like military shoulders. A line of cars appears nervous, their headlights dimmed, as the sentient highway looms over them, demanding documentation with an imposing silhouette against a harsh, bright Florida sunset. The photographic style is hyper-realistic with a slightly surreal, digital art edge, emphasizing the road's menacing bureaucratic personality through sharp, high-contrast lighting and an ominous color palette of burnt oranges and steel grays.")

In an unprecedented development, Florida's main turnpike has become self-aware and is now conducting its own immigration enforcement, causing massive delays as the conscious concrete demands documentation from all passing vehicles.

The 312-mile stretch of highway, which recently upgraded its AI-powered toll system, has begun refusing passage to any vehicle that cannot prove its occupants' citizenship status. The road has also started spontaneously generating exit ramps leading directly to deportation centers.

"The road clearly states in its terms of service that it identifies as American-made," explained Infrastructure Rights Activist Chuck Pavewell. "We've had to reclassify it from Interstate to Interrogate," added Department of Transportation official Sarah Lane.

The situation has created a new meaning for "road to citizenship," with vehicles now required to navigate an increasingly complex series of bureaucratic lanes and regulatory off-ramps. Foreign-made vehicles report feeling particularly discriminated against.

The turnpike defended its actions in a series of morse code signals tapped out through rumble strips, stating it was "just following its concrete conscience" and "protecting American asphalt from foreign traffic."

State officials are now worried other infrastructure might follow suit, as several bridges have already begun humming "God Bless America."
